### Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. Ensure the test suite passes.

### Coding Style

Avoid abbreviations.
Use PEP-8 style guidelines, if not otherwise outlined here.
Use 2-space indents (no tabs).
Maximum line length is 100 characters.
Trailing whitespaces should be trimmed in each line.
TODO comments should indicate the responsible person, like this:
```
  # TODO(john): comment goes here
```
For the sake of simplicity, we're using only TODO comments, no FIXMEs, etc.
